Here’s a clean **README.md** file fully adapted for a `create-react-app` React.js project:

---

````markdown
# React.js Project

This is a **React.js** project bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
````

Then, start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
```

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser to view the app.

You can start editing by modifying files inside the `src` folder (e.g., `src/App.js`).
The page will automatically reload as you save changes.

I can also **add sections for features, screenshots, and environment variables** if you want this README to be production-ready. That would make it look more professional for GitHub.
